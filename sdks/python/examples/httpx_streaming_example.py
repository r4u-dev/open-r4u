    print("""
The httpx tracing system detects streaming responses using httpx's stream parameter:

1. httpx stream parameter:
   - client.send(request, stream=True) - the most reliable way to indicate streaming
   - When stream=True is passed, the response is wrapped for tracing
   - No complex detection logic needed - just use the stream parameter

2. How it works:
   - When stream=True is passed to client.send(), response is wrapped
   - Content is collected as it's read via iter_bytes(), iter_text(), etc.
   - Trace is sent only when streaming completes or is aborted

3. Usage:
   ```python
   # Streaming request (recommended approach)
   request = client.build_request("POST", url, json=data)
   response = await client.send(request, stream=True)
   async for chunk in response.iter_bytes():
       process_chunk(chunk)
   # Trace sent here when streaming completes
   
   # Regular request  
   response = await client.post(url, json=data)
   # Trace sent immediately
   ```

Key Benefits:
- âœ… Simple and reliable - uses httpx's own stream parameter
- âœ… Complete response content is captured
- âœ… Accurate timing (includes full streaming duration)
- âœ… Works with both sync and async httpx clients
- âœ… No complex detection logic needed
- âœ… Handles errors and aborted streams gracefully

Key Takeaways:
1. Use client.send(request, stream=True) for streaming requests
2. Streaming responses are automatically wrapped and traced
3. Complete response content is collected during streaming
4. Traces are sent when streaming completes or is aborted
5. Provides detailed tracing information
6. Simple and reliable - uses httpx's own stream parameter
